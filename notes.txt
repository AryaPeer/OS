How a Computer Starts: 
1. BIOS is copied from a ROM chip to RAM
2. BIOS starts executing code
    - Initializes hardware
    - runs some tests (POST = power on self-test)
3. BIOS searches for an operating system to starts
4. BIOS loads and starts the operating system
5. Operating system runs

How the BIOS Finds an OS:
Legacy Booting:
-Bios loads first sector of each bootable device into memory
-bios checks for a signature
-once found starts executing code

EFI:
-Bios looks into special EFI partitions
-OS must be compiled as an EFI program
